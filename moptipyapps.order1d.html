We do not know and also do not care about in how many dimension the objects exist - we just have objects and a distance metric.<p>Now we want to find a one-dimensional order of the objects that reflects their original distance-based topology. For each object <cite>a</cite>, we want that its closest neighbor in the order is also its actual closest neighbor according to the distance metric. It’s second-closest neighbor should be the actual second-closest neighbor according to the distance metric. And so on.<p>Since we only care about the object order and do not want to metrically map the distances to one dimension, we can represent the solution as permutation of natural numbers.<p>Of course, in a one-dimensional order, each object has exactly two closest neighbors (the one on its left and the one on its right) unless it is situated either at the beginning or end of the order, in which case it has exactly one closest neighbor. Based on the actual distance metric, an object may have any number of closest neighbors, maybe only one, or maybe three equally-far away objects. So it is not clear whether a perfect mapping to the one-dimensional permutations even exists. Probably it will not, but this shall not bother us.<p>Either way, we can try to find one that comes as close as possible to the real deal.<p>Another way to describe this problem is as follows: Imagine that you have <cite>n</cite> objects and only know their mutual distances. You want to arrange them on a one-dimensional axis in a way that does sort of reflect their neighborhood structure in whatever space they are originally located in.<p>The goal of solving this one-dimensional ordering problem is then to arrange <cite>n</cite> objects on a 1-dimensional (e.g., horizontal) axis given a distance matrix describing their location in a potentially high-dimensional or unstructured space. The objects should be arranged in such a way that, for each object,<ul class=simple><li><p>the nearest neighbors on the 1-dimensional axis are also the nearest neighbors in the original space (according to the distance matrix provided),<li><p>the second nearest neighbors on the 1-dimensional axis are also the second nearest neighbors in the original space (according to the distance matrix provided),<li><p>the third nearest neighbors on the 1-dimensional axis are also the third nearest neighbors in the original space (according to the distance matrix provided),<li><p>and so on; with (e.g., quadratically) decreasing weights of neighbor distance ranks.</ul><p>We do not care about the actual precise distances (e.g., something like “0.001”) between the objects on either the one-dimensional nor the original space. We only care about the distance ranks, i.e., about “2nd nearest neighbor,” but not “0.012 distance units away.” The solutions of this problem are thus permutations (orders) of the objects. Of course, if we really want to plot the objects, such a permutation can easily be translated to <cite>x</cite>-coordinates, say, by dividing the index of an object by the number of objects, which nets values in <cite>[0,1]</cite>. But basically, we reduce the task to finding permutations of objects that reflect the neighbor structure of the original space as closely as possible.<p>If such a problem is solved correctly, then the arrangement on the one-dimensional axis should properly reflect the arrangement of the objects in the original space. Of course, solving this problem exactly may not actually be possible, since an object on a one-dimensional axis may either have exactly two <cite>i</cite>-nearest-neighbors (if it is at least <cite>i</cite> slots away from either end of the permutation) or exactly <cite>1</cite> such neighbor, if it is closer that <cite>i</cite> units. The object directly at the start of the permutation has only 1 nearest neighbor (the object that comes next). That next object, however, has two, namely the first object and the third object. In the original space where the objects come from, however, there may be any number of “nearest neighbors.” Imagine a two-dimensional space where one object sits at the center of a circle of other objects. Then all other objects are its nearest neighbors, whereas an object on the circle either has exactly two nearest neighbors or, maybe, in the odd situation that the radius equals a multiple of the distance to the neighbors on the circle, three. Such a structure cannot be represented exactly in one dimension.<p>But that’s OK. Because we mainly do this for visualization purposes anyway.<p>Now here comes the cool thing: We can cast this problem to a Quadratic Assignment Problem (<a class="reference internal"href=moptipyapps.qap.html#module-moptipyapps.qap title=moptipyapps.qap><code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal notranslate"><span class=pre>qap</span></code></a>). A QAP is defined by a distance matrix and a flow matrix. The idea is to assign <cite>n</cite> facilities to locations. The distances between the locations are given by the distance matrix. At the same time, the flow matrix defines the flows between the facilities. The goal is to find the assignment of facilities to locations that minimizes the overall “flow times distance” product sum.<p>We can translate the “One-Dimensional Ordering Problem” to the QAP as follows: Imagine that we have <cite>n</cite> unique objects and know the (symmetric) distances between them.<p>Let’s say that we have four numbers as objects, <cite>1</cite>, <cite>2</cite>, <cite>3</cite>, <cite>4</cite>.<div class="doctest highlight-default notranslate"><div class=highlight><pre><span></span><span class=gp>>>> </span><span class=n>data</span> <span class=o>=</span> <span class=p>[</span><span class=mi>1</span><span class=p>,</span> <span class=mi>2</span><span class=p>,</span> <span class=mi>3</span><span class=p>,</span> <span class=mi>4</span><span class=p>]</span>
