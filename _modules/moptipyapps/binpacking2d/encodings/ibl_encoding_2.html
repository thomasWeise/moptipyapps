<span class=sd>An improved bottom left encoding by Liu and Teng extended to multiple bins.</span>

<span class=sd>Here we provide an implementation of the improved bottom left encoding by Liu</span>
<span class=sd>and Teng [1], but extended to bins with limited height. If the height of the</span>
<span class=sd>bin is a limiting factor, then our implementation will automatically use</span>
<span class=sd>multiple bins. Another variant is given in</span>
<span class=sd>:mod:`moptipyapps.binpacking2d.encodings.ibl_encoding_1`.</span>

<span class=sd>An instance :mod:`~moptipyapps.binpacking2d.instance` of the</span>
<span class=sd>two-dimensional bin packing problem defines a set of objects to be packed</span>
<span class=sd>and a bin size (width and height). Each object to be packed has itself a</span>
<span class=sd>width and a height as well as a repetition counter, which is `1` if the object</span>
<span class=sd>only occurs a single time and larger otherwise (i.e., if the repetition</span>
<span class=sd>counter is `5`, the object needs to be packaged five times).</span>

<span class=sd>The encoding receives signed permutations with repetitions as input. Each</span>
<span class=sd>element of the permutation identifies one object from the bin packing</span>
<span class=sd>instance. Each such object ID must occur exactly as often as the repetition</span>
<span class=sd>counter of the object in the instance data suggest. But the ID may also occur</span>
<span class=sd>negated, in which case the object is supposed to rotated by 90°.</span>

<span class=sd>Now our encoding processes such a permutation from beginning to end. It starts</span>
<span class=sd>with an empty bin `1`. Each object is first placed with its right end at the</span>
<span class=sd>right end of the first bin and with its bottom line exactly at the top of the</span>
<span class=sd>bin, i.e., outside of the bin. Then, in each step, we move the object as far</span>
<span class=sd>down as possible. Then, we move it to the left as far as possible, but we</span>
<span class=sd>immediately stop if there was another chance to move the object down. In</span>
<span class=sd>other words, downward movements are preferred over left movements. This is</span>
<span class=sd>repeated until no movement of the object is possible anymore.</span>

<span class=sd>Once the object cannot be moved anymore, we check if it is fully inside the</span>
<span class=sd>bin. If yes, then the object is included in the bin and we continue with the</span>
<span class=sd>next object. If not, it does not fit into the bin.</span>

<span class=sd>This is the "Improved Bottom Left" heuristic by Liu and Teng [1].</span>

<span class=sd>If the object does not fit into the first bin and we already "opened" a second</span>
<span class=sd>bin, then we try to place it into the second bin using the same procedure. And</span>
<span class=sd>then into the third bin if that does not work out, and so on. Until we have</span>
<span class=sd>tried unsuccessfully all the bins that we have opened.</span>

<span class=sd>In this case, we "open" the next bin and we place the object at the</span>
<span class=sd>bottom-left corner of a new bin. Then we continue with the next object, again</span>
<span class=sd>trying to put it into the first bin, then the second bin, and so on.</span>

<span class=sd>This is different from the first variant of this encoding implemented in file</span>
<span class=sd>:mod:`moptipyapps.binpacking2d.encodings.ibl_encoding_2`, which always and</span>
<span class=sd>only tries to put objects into the last bin that was opened (and moves to a</span>
<span class=sd>new bin if that does not work out). That variant of the encoding is therefore</span>
<span class=sd>faster than the one here, but the one here tends to yield better packings.</span>

<span class=sd>The problem with this is that we need to basically first try to put the object</span>
<span class=sd>into the first bin. For this we need to look at *all* the objects that we have</span>
<span class=sd>already placed, because it could be that we already have one object in the</span>
<span class=sd>first bin, then one in the second bin that did not fit into the first bin,</span>
<span class=sd>then one smaller object in the first bin again, and so on. If our new object</span>
<span class=sd>does not fit into the first bin, then we need to do the same with the second</span>
<span class=sd>bin, and so on. So for every bin we try, we need to look at all objects already</span>
<span class=sd>placed. And the number of bins we could try could be equal to the number of</span>
<span class=sd>objects that we have already placed (if each object occupies one bin alone).</span>
<span class=sd>So we have a worst case complexity of O(n ** 2) for placing one object. And we</span>
<span class=sd>do this for all objects, so we would have a O(n ** 3) overall complexity.</span>
<span class=sd>Well, actually, it is worse: Because we repeat the process of looking at all</span>
<span class=sd>the objects several times while moving our new item to the left and down and</span>
<span class=sd>to the left and down. So I suspect that we actually have O(n ** 4).</span>
<span class=sd>That is annoying.</span>

<span class=sd>We try to alleviate this a little bit by remembering, for each bin, the index</span>
<span class=sd>of the first object that we put in there and the index of the last object we</span>
<span class=sd>put in there. Now within these two indices, there also might be objects that</span>
<span class=sd>we placed into other bins. But for a very little overhead (remembering two</span>
<span class=sd>values per bin), we have a certain chance to speed up the process in several</span>
<span class=sd>situations. For instance, the worst case from above, that each object occupies</span>
<span class=sd>exactly one bin by itself becomes easier because we would only look at one</span>
<span class=sd>already placed object per bin.</span>

<span class=sd>    Move the box at index `i1` down as far as possible in the current bin.</span>

<span class=sd>    `bin_start` is the index of the first object that has already been placed</span>
<span class=sd>    in the current bin `bin_id`. It always holds that `i1 >= bin_start`. In</span>
<span class=sd>    the case that `i1 == bin_start`, then we can move the object directly to</span>
<span class=sd>    the bottom of the bin without any issue.</span>
<span class=sd>    If `i1 > bin_start` we iterate over all objects at indices</span>
<span class=sd>    `bin_start...bin_end - 1` whose bin equals `bin`. We first set `min_down`</span>
<span class=sd>    to the bottom-y coordinate of the box, because this is how far down we can</span>
<span class=sd>    move at most.</span>

<span class=sd>    Then, for each of the objects already placed in the bin `bin_id`, we check</span>
<span class=sd>    if there is any intersection of the horizontal with the current box. If</span>
<span class=sd>    there is no intersection *or* if the object is not already above the</span>
<span class=sd>    current box, then the object will not influence the downward movement of</span>
<span class=sd>    our object. If there is an intersection, then we cannot move the current</span>
<span class=sd>    box deeper than the top-y coordinate of the other box.</span>

<span class=sd>    *Only* the box at index `i1` is modified and if it is modified, this</span>

<span class=sd>    preferred compared to left moves. This means that the box needs to be</span>
<span class=sd>    stopped when reaching the edge of a box on whose top it sits. Of course,</span>
<span class=sd>    we only consider other objects inside the current bin</span>
<span class=sd>    (with ID `bin_start`).</span>

<span class=sd>    This function is to be called *after* `__move_down` and in an alternating</span>
<span class=sd>    fashion.</span>

<span class=sd>    *Only* the box at index `i1` is modified and if it is modified, this</span>
<span class=sd>    function will return `True`.</span>

<span class=sd>    Decode a (signed) permutation to a packing.</span>

<span class=sd>    The permutation is processed from the beginning to the end.</span>
<span class=sd>    Each element identifies one object by its ID. If the ID is negative,</span>
<span class=sd>    the object will be inserted rotated by 90°. If the ID is positive, the</span>
<span class=sd>    object will be inserted as is.</span>

<span class=sd>    The absolute value of the ID-1 will be used to look up the width and</span>
<span class=sd>    height of the object in the `instance` data. If the object needs to be</span>
<span class=sd>    rotated, width and height will be swapped.</span>

<span class=sd>    Each object is, at the beginning, placed with its right side at the right</span>
<span class=sd>    end of the *first* bin. The bottom line of the object is initially put on</span>
<span class=sd>    top of the bin, i.e., initially the object is outside of the bin.</span>

<span class=sd>    Then, the object is iteratively moved downward *in the bin* as far as</span>
<span class=sd>    possible. Once it reaches another object, we move it to the left until</span>
<span class=sd>    either its right side reaches the left end of the object beneath it or</span>
<span class=sd>    until its left side touches another object. Then we try to move the object</span>
<span class=sd>    down again, and so on.</span>

<span class=sd>    Once the object can no longer be moved down, we check if it is now fully</span>
<span class=sd>    inside of *the bin*. If yes, then good, the object's bin index is set to</span>
<span class=sd>    the ID of the current bin. If not, then we cannot place the object into</span>
<span class=sd>    this bin. In this case, we move to the second bin an repeat the process.</span>
<span class=sd>    If the object fits into the second bin, then it is placed in there and</span>
<span class=sd>    we are finished. If not, we try the third bin, and so on.</span>

<span class=sd>    If we cannot fit the object into any of the bins that already have other</span>
<span class=sd>    objects, then we allocate a new empty bin. We move the object to the</span>
<span class=sd>    bottom-left corner of this bin. In other words, the left side of the</span>
<span class=sd>    object touches the left side of the bin, i.e., is `0`. The bottom-line</span>
<span class=sd>    of the object is also the bottom of the bin, i.e., has coordinate `0` as</span>
<span class=sd>    well.</span>

<span class=sd>    :param x: a possibly signed permutation</span>
<span class=sd>    :param y: the packing object</span>
<span class=sd>    :param instance: the packing instance data</span>

<span class=sd>    :param bin_ends: a temporary index holder array for bin ends</span>
<span class=sd>    :returns: the number of bins</span>

<span class=sd>    As example, we use a slightly modified version (we add more objects so we</span>
<span class=sd>    get to see the use of a second bin) of Figure 2 of the Liu and Teng paper</span>
