"""
An improved bottom left encoding by Liu and Teng extended to multiple bins.

Here we provide an implementation of the improved bottom left encoding by Liu
and Teng [1], but extended to bins with limited height. If the height of the
bin is a limiting factor, then our implementation will automatically use
multiple bins. Another variant is given in
:mod:`moptipyapps.binpacking2d.encodings.ibl_encoding_1`.

An instance :mod:`~moptipyapps.binpacking2d.instance` of the
two-dimensional bin packing problem defines a set of objects to be packed
and a bin size (width and height). Each object to be packed has itself a
width and a height as well as a repetition counter, which is `1` if the object
only occurs a single time and larger otherwise (i.e., if the repetition
counter is `5`, the object needs to be packaged five times).

The encoding receives signed permutations with repetitions as input. Each
element of the permutation identifies one object from the bin packing
instance. Each such object ID must occur exactly as often as the repetition
counter of the object in the instance data suggest. But the ID may also occur
negated, in which case the object is supposed to rotated by 90°.

Now our encoding processes such a permutation from beginning to end. It starts
with an empty bin `1`. Each object is first placed with its right end at the
right end of the first bin and with its bottom line exactly at the top of the
bin, i.e., outside of the bin. Then, in each step, we move the object as far
down as possible. Then, we move it to the left as far as possible, but we
immediately stop if there was another chance to move the object down. In
other words, downward movements are preferred over left movements. This is
repeated until no movement of the object is possible anymore.

Once the object cannot be moved anymore, we check if it is fully inside the
bin. If yes, then the object is included in the bin and we continue with the
next object. If not, it does not fit into the bin.

This is the "Improved Bottom Left" heuristic by Liu and Teng [1].

If the object does not fit into the first bin and we already "opened" a second
bin, then we try to place it into the second bin using the same procedure. And
then into the third bin if that does not work out, and so on. Until we have
tried unsuccessfully all the bins that we have opened.

In this case, we "open" the next bin and we place the object at the
bottom-left corner of a new bin. Then we continue with the next object, again
trying to put it into the first bin, then the second bin, and so on.

This is different from the first variant of this encoding implemented in file
:mod:`moptipyapps.binpacking2d.encodings.ibl_encoding_2`, which always and
only tries to put objects into the last bin that was opened (and moves to a
new bin if that does not work out). That variant of the encoding is therefore
faster than the one here, but the one here tends to yield better packings.

The problem with this is that we need to basically first try to put the object
into the first bin. For this we need to look at *all* the objects that we have
already placed, because it could be that we already have one object in the
first bin, then one in the second bin that did not fit into the first bin,
then one smaller object in the first bin again, and so on. If our new object
does not fit into the first bin, then we need to do the same with the second
bin, and so on. So for every bin we try, we need to look at all objects already
placed. And the number of bins we could try could be equal to the number of
objects that we have already placed (if each object occupies one bin alone).
So we have a worst case complexity of O(n ** 2) for placing one object. And we
do this for all objects, so we would have a O(n ** 3) overall complexity.
Well, actually, it is worse: Because we repeat the process of looking at all
the objects several times while moving our new item to the left and down and
to the left and down. So I suspect that we actually have O(n ** 4).
That is annoying.

We try to alleviate this a little bit by remembering, for each bin, the index
of the first object that we put in there and the index of the last object we
put in there. Now within these two indices, there also might be objects that
we placed into other bins. But for a very little overhead (remembering two
values per bin), we have a certain chance to speed up the process in several
situations. For instance, the worst case from above, that each object occupies
exactly one bin by itself becomes easier because we would only look at one
already placed object per bin.

This procedure has originally been developed and implemented by Mr. Rui ZHAO
(赵睿), <zr1329142665@163.com>, a Master's student at the Institute of Applied
Optimization (应用优化研究所, http://iao.hfuu.edu.cn) of the School of
Artificial Intelligence and Big Data (人工智能与大数据学院) at Hefei University
(合肥学院) in Hefei, Anhui, China (中国安徽省合肥市) under the supervision of
Prof. Dr. Thomas Weise (汤卫思教授).

    Decode a (signed) permutation to a packing.

    The permutation is processed from the beginning to the end.
    Each element identifies one object by its ID. If the ID is negative,
    the object will be inserted rotated by 90°. If the ID is positive, the
    object will be inserted as is.

    The absolute value of the ID-1 will be used to look up the width and
    height of the object in the `instance` data. If the object needs to be
    rotated, width and height will be swapped.

    Each object is, at the beginning, placed with its right side at the right
    end of the *first* bin. The bottom line of the object is initially put on
    top of the bin, i.e., initially the object is outside of the bin.

    Then, the object is iteratively moved downward *in the bin* as far as
    possible. Once it reaches another object, we move it to the left until
    either its right side reaches the left end of the object beneath it or
    until its left side touches another object. Then we try to move the object
    down again, and so on.

    Once the object can no longer be moved down, we check if it is now fully
    inside of *the bin*. If yes, then good, the object's bin index is set to
    the ID of the current bin. If not, then we cannot place the object into
    this bin. In this case, we move to the second bin an repeat the process.
    If the object fits into the second bin, then it is placed in there and
    we are finished. If not, we try the third bin, and so on.

    If we cannot fit the object into any of the bins that already have other
    objects, then we allocate a new empty bin. We move the object to the
    bottom-left corner of this bin. In other words, the left side of the
    object touches the left side of the bin, i.e., is `0`. The bottom-line
    of the object is also the bottom of the bin, i.e., has coordinate `0` as
