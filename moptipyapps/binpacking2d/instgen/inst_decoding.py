A decoder for 2D BPP instances.

The goal of developing this decoding procedure is that we need a deterministic
mapping of some easy-to-process data structure to an instance of the
two-dimensional bin packing problem. The instance produced by the mapping
should use a pre-defined bin width, bin height, and number of items. It should
also have a pre-defined lower bound for the number of bins required and it
must be ensured that this lower bound can also be reached, i.e., that at least
one solution exists that can indeed pack all items into this number of bins.

As source data structure to be mapped, we choose the real vectors of a fixed
length (discussed later on).

The idea is that we take the bin width, bin height, and lower bound of the
number of bins (let's call it `lb`) from a template instance. We also take
the number items (let's call it `n`) from that instance.

Now we begin with `lb` items, each of which exactly of the size and dimensions
of a bin. At the end, we want to have `n` items. To get there, in each step of
our decoding, we split one existing item into two items. This means that each
step will create one additional item for the instance (while making one
existing item smaller). This, in turn, means that we have to do `n - lb`
decoding steps, as we start with `lb` items and, after `n - lb` steps, will
have `lb + n - lb = n` items.

So far so good.
But how do we split?

Each split that we want to perform be defined by four features:

1. the index of the item that we are going to split,
2. whether we split it horizontally or vertically,
3. where we are going to split it,
4. and how to continue if the proposed split is not possible, e.g., because
   it would lead to a zero-width or zero-height item.

Now we can encode this in two real numbers `selector` and `cutter` from the
interval `[-1,1]`.

First, we multiply the absolute value of the `selector` with the current
number of items that we have. This is initially `2`, will then be `3` in the
next iteration, then `4`, and so on.
Converted to an int, the result of this multiplication gives us the index of
the item to split.

Then, if `cutter >= 0`, we will cut the item horizontally. Otherwise, i.e., if
`cutter < 0`, we cut vertically.
Where to cut is then decided by multiplying the absolute value of `cutter`
with the length of the item in the selected cutting dimension.

If that is not possible, we move to the next item and try again.
If `selector < 0`, we move towards smaller indices and wrap after `0`.
Otherwise, we move towards higher indices and wrap at the end of the item
list.
If we arrive back at the first object, this means that the split was not
possible for any of the existing items.
We now rotate the split by 90Â°, i.e., if we tried horizontal splits, we now
try vertical ones and vice versa.

It is easy to see that it must always be possible to split at least one item
in at least one direction. Since we took the bin dimensions and numbers of
items from an existing instance of the benchmark set, it must be possible to
divide the bins into `n` items in one way or another. Therefore, the loop
will eventually terminate and yield the right amount of items.

This means that with `2 * (n - lb)` floating point numbers, we can describe an
instance whose result is a perfect packing, without any wasted space.

Now the benchmark instances are not just instances that can only be solved by
perfect packings. Instead, they have some wasted space.

We now want to add some wasted space to our instance. So far, our items occupy
exactly `lb * bin_width * bin_height` space units. We can cut at most
`bin_width * bin_height - 1` of these units without changing the required bins
of the packing: We would end up with `(lb - 1) * bin_width * bin_height + 1`
space units required by our items, which is `1` too large to fit into `lb - 1`
bins.

So we just do the same thing again:
We again use two real numbers to describe each split.
Like before, we loop through these numbers, pick the object to split, and
compute where to split it. Just now we throw away the piece that was cut off.
(Of course, we compute the split positions such that we never dip under the
area requirement discussed above).

This allows us to use additional real variables to define how the space should
be reduced. `2 * (n - lb)` variables, we get instances requiring perfect
packing. With every additional pair of variables, we cut some more space.
If we would use `2 * (n - lb) + 10` variables, then we would try to select
five items from which we can cut off a bit. This number of additional
variables can be chosen by the user.

Finally, we merge all items that have the same dimension into groups, as is
the case in some of the original instances. We then shuffle these groups
randomly, to give the instances a bit of a more unordered texture.
The random shuffling is seeded with the binary representation of the input
vectors.

In the end, we have translated a real vector to a two-dimensional bin packing
instance. Hurray.
