"""
An objective function indirectly minimizing the number of bins in packings.

This objective function computes the number of bins used. Let's call it
`n_bins`. We know the area `bin_area` of a bin as well. Now we return
`(bin_area * (n_bins - 1)) + area_of_items_in_last_bin`, where
`area_of_items_in_last_bin` is, well, the area covered by items in the
very last bin.

The idea behind this is: If one of two packings has the smaller number of
bins, then this one will always have the smaller objective value. If two
packings have the same number of bins, but one requires less space in the very
last bin, then that one is better. With this mechanism, we drive the search
towards "emptying" the last bin. If the number of items in the last bin would
reach `0`, that last bin would disappear - and we have one bin less.

This objective is similar to :mod:`~moptipyapps.binpacking2d.objectives.\
bin_count_and_small`, with the difference that it focuses on the *last* bin
whereas :mod:`~moptipyapps.binpacking2d.objectives.bin_count_and_small` tries
to minimize the area in *any* bin.
