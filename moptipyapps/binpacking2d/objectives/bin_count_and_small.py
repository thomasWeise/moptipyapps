"""
An objective function indirectly minimizing the number of bins in packings.

This objective function computes the number of bins used. Let's call it
`n_bins`. We know the area `bin_area` of a bin as well. We then compute the
minimum area occupied in any bin, `min_area`. Now we return
`(bin_area * (n_bins - 1)) + min_area`.

This function always prefers a packing that has fewer bins over a packing
with more bins duw to the term `bin_area * (n_bins - 1)` and
`bin_area >= min_area` (let us ignore the case where `bin_area == min_area`,
which does not make practical sense). Since `min_area < bin_area` in all
practically relevant cases, the offset `min_area` just distinguishes
packings that have same number of bins. Amongst such packings, those whose
least-occupied bin is closer to being empty are preferred (regardless where
this bin is). The idea is that this will eventually allow us to get rid of
that least-occupied bin in subsequent optimization steps, i.e., to reduce
the number of bins.

This is similar to the :mod:`~moptipyapps.binpacking2d.objectives.\
bin_count_and_small` objective, except that we do not try to expunge the last
bin, but any bin. It has the same lower and upper bound, though.
