"""
An objective function evaluating a permutation of objects.

The goal is to find an order of objects such that the ranks of their distances
inside the permutation match to the distance ranks inside the instance data.

In other words, we take a permutation and consider the distance between two
elements the differences of their indices in th permutation. So we can
translate a permutation to a distance matrix. Then we transform the distance
matrix into a "distance rank matrix", where for each object (row), we compute
the distance rank of each neighbor, exactly as we do in the problem
:mod:`~moptipyapps.order1d.instance`. Ideally, the resulting distance rank
matrix should be exactly the same as the :mod:`~moptipyapps.order1d.instance`,
which is also such a matrix.

As objective value, we first compute the element-wise absolute difference
between both matrices and element-wise divide it by the element-wise square
of the instance matrix. We then return the arithmetic mean over all elements
in the result matrix. (Actually, using the square is just default setting,
you can use any power you like...)

If this mean value hits `0.0`, we have found an exact mapping of objects to
positions. Normally, we will not be able to reach such a value, though. But
the closer we get to `0`, the better should the representation be.

The objective function is symmetric with respect to the permutation, i.e.,
ordering the objects Ã  la `[0, 1, 2, 3]` is the same as ordering them in
`[3, 2, 1, 0]`.

First, let's construct an instance.
>>> def _dist(a, b):
...     return abs(a - b)
>>> def _tags(a):
...     return f"t{a}"
>>> the_instance = Instance.from_sequence_and_distance(
...     [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], _tags, _dist)

Now let's create the objective function:
>>> the_objective = OneDimensionalDistribution(the_instance)
>>> the_x = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4], int)
>>> the_objective.evaluate(the_x)
0.0

>>> the_x = np.array([1, 0, 2, 3, 4], int)
>>> the_objective.evaluate(the_x)
0.02878505920886873

>>> the_x = np.array([2, 1, 0, 3, 4], int)
>>> the_objective.evaluate(the_x)
0.04803169564121945

>>> the_x = np.array([4, 3, 2, 1, 0], int)
>>> the_objective.evaluate(the_x)
0.0
