"""
An objective functions for the dynamic control problem.

The dynamic control problem means that our system starts in a given state
and we try to move it to a stable state by using control effort. Controllers
are trained over several training states, for each of which we can compute a
figure of merit.

We offer two different approaches for this:

- :class:`FigureOfMerit` computes the arithmetic mean `z` over the separate
  figures of merit `J` of the training cases.
- :class:`FigureOfMeritLE` tries to smooth out the impact of bad starting
  states by computing `exp(mean[log(J + 1)]) - 1`.

These objective functions also offer a way to collect the state+control and
corresponding differential vectors.
