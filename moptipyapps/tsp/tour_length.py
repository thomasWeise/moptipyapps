The tour length objective function for tours in path representation.

A Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) instance  is defined as a
fully-connected graph with
:attr:`~moptipyapps.tsp.instance.Instance.n_cities` nodes. Each edge in the
graph has a weight, which identifies the distance between the nodes. The goal
is to find the *shortest* tour that visits every single node in the graph
exactly once and then returns back to its starting node. Then nodes are
usually called cities. In this file, we present methods for loading instances
of the TSP as distance matrices `A`. In other words, the value at `A[i, j]`
identifies the travel distance from `i` to `j`.

A tour can be represented in path representation, which means that it is
stored as a permutation of the numbers `0` to `n_cities-1`. The number at
index `k` identifies that `k`-th city to visit. So the first number in the
permutation identifies the first city, the second number the second city,
and so on.

The length of the tour can be computed by summing up the distances from the
`k`-th city to the `k+1`-st city, for `k` in `0..n_cities-2` and then adding
the distance from the last city to the first city. This is what the function
:func:`tour_length` is doing. This function is then wrapped as objective
function object in :class:`TourLength`.
