A (1+1) EA for the TSP using the reversal move.

A (1+1) EA is basically a local search :mod:`~moptipy.algorithms.so.rls`
algorithm that starts with a random solution as the current solution `x`. In
each iteration, it samples one new solution from the neighborhood of `x` and
accepts it (as the new `x`), if it is better or equally good.
The algorithm here applies the reversal move, i.e., a two-opt move, as the
unary search operator used for sampling the neighborhood of `x`. The
interesting thing about this operator, when applied to the TSP, is that we
can compute the tour length of the new solution in `O(1)` from the tour length
of the current solution. This means we can very quickly decide whether the
move would be acceptable - and only apply it (in `O(n)`) if its.

The algorithm implemented here is the same as the basic (1+1) EA with `rev`
operator in the paper [1].
