"""
A permutation-with-repetition-based encoding based on games with rescheduling.

This game-based encoding method is an extension of the method presented in
:mod:`~moptipyapps.ttp.game_encoding`. The method presented in
:mod:`~moptipyapps.ttp.game_encoding` takes a permutation of games and fills
these games into a game plan one-by-one. For each game it tries to find the
earliest possible slot where it can be scheduled, i.e., the earliest slot
where both involved teams do not yet have a game scheduled.

During this process, it can happen that a game cannot be added to the game
plan, because on each day, at least one of the two teams has already a game
scheduled. In such a case, the original encoding will simply drop the game.
This results in "byes" in the game plan.

This new encoding tries to reduce the number of such byes. It does this as
follows: It still processes the game permutations from front to end and
adds the games to the schedule. If one game cannot be added to the schedule
due to the above reason, it will go through game plan again from beginning
to end. This time, it will look for a day on which only *one* of the two teams
has a game scheduled already. It will then take this already-scheduled game
and try to schedule it on a *later* day. This is a recursive process: If no
later slot is found where both teams involved have no game scheduled, we will
again look for a day on which only one of the teams have scheduled a game and
try to move that to a later slot. Since this will be an even later slot, the
recursion will never go too deep. Either way, if a later slot is found, the
game can be moved, meaning that the original game blocking our "current" game
can be moved as well. Then the new game can be inserted.

If no such slot can be found, then we try to insert the game by searching
from the back end and moving other games forward in the same recursive
fashion. The hope is that, this way, the number of "byes" in the schedule can
be reduced. If the number of "byes" is reduced, then there will automatically
fewer constraint violations. This makes it more likely that we discover a
feasible schedule earlier in the search.

Furthermore, the process might even make it easier for a search to move from
one feasible schedule to another one. There would hopefully be fewer
permutations leading to infeasible schedules and fewer infeasible schedules
between two feasible ones.

Of course, all of that comes at the cost of increased runtime.
