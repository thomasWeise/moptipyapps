"""
A permutation-with-repetition-based encoding based on games.

A point in the search space is a permutation (potentially with repetitions)
that can be translated to a :class:`~moptipyapps.ttp.game_plan.GamePlan`.
Each value `v` in the permutation represents a game to be played by two of
the `n` teams. There are `n(n-1)` possible games between `n` teams,
distinguishing home and away teams. Given a value `v` from `0..n(n-1)-1`,
we can get the zero-based index of the home team as
`home_idx = (game // (n - 1)) % n`. The away index is computed in two steps,
first we set `away_idx = game % (n - 1)` and if `away_idx >= home_idx`, we
do `away_idx = away_idx + 1`. (Because a team can never play against itself,
the situation that `home_idx == away_idx` does not need to be represented, so
we can "skip" over this possible value by doing the `away_idx = away_idy + 1`
and thus get a more "compact" numeric range for the permutation elements.)

A game schedule for any round-robin tournament with any given number of rounds
can then be represented as permutation (potentially with repetitions) of these
game values. In the decoding procedure, it is processed from beginning to end
each game is then placed into the earliest slot not already occupied by
another game. In other words, it is placed at the earliest day at which both
involved teams do not yet have other games. If no such slot is available, this
game is not placed at all. In this case, there will be some zeros in the game
plan after the encoding. No other constraint is considered at this stage.

In other words, this encoding may produce game plans that violate constraints.
It does not care about the streak length constraints.
It does not ensure that each team always has a game.
Therefore, it should only be used in conjunction with objective functions that
force the search towards feasible solutions, such as the
:mod:`~moptipyapps.ttp.errors` objective.

In :mod:`~moptipyapps.ttp.game_encoding_2`, we present a modified version of
this encoding procedure that tries to reduce the number of zeros, i.e.,
"byes," in the resulting schedule.

    Re-encode a game plan to a permutation.

    `x` must be a valid permutation. It is then transformed based on the game
    plan `y` to represent `y` in a straightforward manner. The general
    contract of this function is that:

    - `y` can be a game plan of any kind, with all sorts of game scheduling
       error except one: If team A plays team B in one slot, then team B must
       also play against team A in that slot and exactly one of them is the
       home team and one of them is the away team. Apart from that, there can
       be arbitrary byes or streak violations.
    - `x` must a valid game permutation, but can be entirely unrelated
       to `y`.
    - This function will then transform `x` such that `map_games(x, z)` will
      result in a game plan such that `z = y`.

    Due to the possibility of byes, it can happen that after
    `map_games(x1, z)` and `re_encode(x2, z)` it may be that `x1 != x2`.
    The reason is that the order of game IDs n `x2` for games that were not
    scheduled in `z` will be undefined.
