"""
An objective computing the total travel length of all teams in a game plan.

This objective function takes a game plan as argument and computes the total
travel length for all teams.
A :mod:`~moptipyapps.ttp.game_plan` is basically a matrix that, for each day
(first dimension) stores against which each team (second dimension) plays.
If a team plays at home (has a home game), its opponent is stored as a
positive number.
If the team has an away game, i.e., needs to visit the opponent, then this
opponent is stored as a negative number.
Team IDs go from `1` to `n`, i.e., a value in `1..n` indicates a home game
and a value in `-n..-1` indicates an away game.
The value `0` denotes a `bye`, i.e., that no game is scheduled for a team
at the given day.

The total game plan length is computed as follows:

1. the total length = 0
2. for each team,
    1. start at the current location = home
    2. for each day,
        1. if the opponent number is negative, the next location is the
           opponent's hometown;
        2. else if the opponent number is positive, the next location is the
           own hometown;
        3. else (if the opponent number is 0): add the `bye penalty` to the
           total length and jump to the next iteration
        4. add the distance from the current to the next location to the total
           length
        5. set the current location = the next location
    3. if the current location != own hometown, add the travel distance back
       from the current location to the hometown to the total travel length.

As penalty for the `bye` situation where no game is scheduled, we use twice
the maximum distance between any two teams plus 1.
The logic is that if a `bye` (i.e., a `0`) inserted into a game plan, it
replaces one game. Since it replaces one game, it affects up to two travels,
namely from the previous location to the game location and from the game
location to the next location.
So the optimization process could sneakily try to cut longer legs of the
tournament by inserting a `bye`.
The longest imaginable travel would be between the two cities that are
farthest away from each other and back.
By making the penalty for a `bye` exactly one distance unit longer than
this longest imaginable distance, we ensure that the travel length can
never be reduced by inserting a `bye`.
Thus, having a `bye` is always more costly than any other travel it could
replace.
