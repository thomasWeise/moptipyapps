The Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP).

The quadratic assignment problem represents assignments of facilities to
locations. Between each pair of facilities, there is a flow of goods. Between
each two locations, there is a distance. The goal is to assign facilities to
locations such that the overall sum of the products of distance and flow gets
minimized. Each instance therefore presents a matrix with
:attr:`~moptipyapps.qap.instance.Instance.distances` and a matrix with flows
:attr:`~moptipyapps.qap.instance.Instance.flows`. The
:mod:`~moptipyapps.qap.objective` is then to minimize said product sum.
