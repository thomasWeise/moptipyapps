Plot a 2-dimensional packing.

Here we try out the two different variants of the improved-bottom-left
encoding. `ImprovedBottomLeftEncoding1` inserts objects one by one and moves
on to a new bin once an object doesn't fit into the current bin. It will then
never consider the filled bin again. `ImprovedBottomLeftEncoding2` always
tries all bins for any object.

We try both encodings for instance `a10` and fixed (but randomly chosen)
signed permutation as input string.

You will see that `ImprovedBottomLeftEncoding1` needs four bins, whereas
`ImprovedBottomLeftEncoding2` needs three.

In the file `binpacking2d_rls.py`, we plug `ImprovedBottomLeftEncoding2` into
a simple randomized local search. This search runs for 1024 steps and finds a
packing that only needs two bins.

# So we include each of n_different_items item IDs exactly as often as
# it should be repeated. We sometimes include it directly and sometimes
# in the negated form, which is interpreted as a 90Â° rotation by the encoding.

# the array. The encoding then inserts the items in the same sequence they
